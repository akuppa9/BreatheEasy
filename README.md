# Breathe Easy

Breathe Easy is an iOS app that consistently estimates and notifies a users' relative ACT Score, a metric correlated to asthma control, based on a multitude of environmental and health related variables. The purpose of this application is to assist users that struggle with common asthma symptoms to ease the stress and difficulty that comes with constantly worrying about your next asthma attack. A deep convolutional neural network is used for the prediction.

## Local Model Deployment

To deploy local flask application to call model

```bash
  flask --app flaskapis run
```
[Example URL to test model](http://127.0.0.1:5000/22.0/2.54/0.77/4.84/1040.0/98.0/0.51/0.0/2.0/283.72/20.39/21.99/2.27/11.64/16.40/0.39/83.0)

## Moving Forward

- Hosting model on AWS Sagemaker
- Improve Model through addition of paramters
- Create User test to provide feedback for model
- Create WatchOS app
- Connect to weather API's
